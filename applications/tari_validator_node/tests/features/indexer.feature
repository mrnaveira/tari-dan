  @current
  @serial
  Scenario: Indexer is able to connect to validator nodes
    # Initialize a base node, wallet, miner and VN
    Given a base node BASE
    Given a wallet WALLET connected to base node BASE
    Given a miner MINER connected to base node BASE and wallet WALLET

    # Initialize a VN
    Given a validator node VN connected to base node BASE and wallet WALLET

    # Initialize an indexer
    Given an indexer IDX connected to base node BASE
    Then the indexer IDX is connected

    # Uncomment the following lines to stop execution for manual inspection of the nodes
    # When I print the cucumber world
