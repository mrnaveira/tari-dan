Feature: Account transfers

  @serial
  Scenario: Transfer tokens to unexisting account
    # Initialize a base node, wallet, miner and VN
    Given a base node BASE
    Given a wallet WALLET connected to base node BASE
    Given a miner MINER connected to base node BASE and wallet WALLET

    # Initialize a VN
    Given a validator node VN connected to base node BASE and wallet WALLET
    When miner MINER mines 4 new blocks
    When validator node VN sends a registration transaction
    When miner MINER mines 16 new blocks
    Then the validator node VN is listed as registered

    # Initialize the wallet daemon
    Given a wallet daemon WALLET_D connected to validator node VN

    # A file-base CLI account must be created to sign future calls
    When I create a DAN wallet
    When I wait 3 seconds

    # Register the "faucet" template
    When validator node VN registers the template "faucet"
    # Mine some blocks until the UTXOs are scanned
    When miner MINER mines 15 new blocks
    Then the validator node VN is listed as registered
    Then the template "faucet" is listed as registered by the validator node VN

    # Create a new Faucet component
    When I call function "mint" on template "faucet" on VN with args "amount_10000" and 3 outputs named "FAUCET" with new resource "test"

    # Create and fund the sender account
    When I create an account ACC_1 via the wallet daemon WALLET_D
    When I submit a transaction manifest on VN with inputs "FAUCET, ACC_1" and 3 outputs named "TX1"
        ```
            let faucet = global!["FAUCET/components/TestFaucet"];
            let mut acc1 = global!["ACC_1/components/Account"];

            // get tokens from the faucet
            let faucet_bucket = faucet.take_free_coins();
            acc1.deposit(faucet_bucket);
        ```
    #Â Wait for the wallet daemon account monitor to update the sender account information
    When I wait 10 seconds
    
    # Do the transfer from ACC_1 to the second account (which does not exist yet in the network)
    When I create a new key pair KEY_ACC_2
    When I transfer 50 tokens of resource FAUCET/resources/0 from account ACC_1 to public key KEY_ACC_2 via the wallet daemon WALLET_D named TRANSFER

    # Check that ACC_2 component was created and has funds
    When I submit a transaction manifest on VN with inputs "FAUCET, TRANSFER" and 1 output named "TX2"
      ```
        let mut acc2 = global!["TRANSFER/components/Account"];
        let faucet_resource = global!["FAUCET/resources/0"];
        acc2.balance(faucet_resource);
      ```
